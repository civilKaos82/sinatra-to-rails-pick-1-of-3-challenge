# Sinatra To Rails Pick 1 Of 3

## Summary

 Pick one of the following three Sinatra-based challenges and build it in Rails:

1. [Web Flashcards Challenge](../../../../web-flashcards-challenge)
1. [Stack Overflow Clone](../../../sinatra-overflow-challenge)

Focus first and foremost on doing things the "Rails way."  Rails' idiomatic
style can be frustrating coming from simpler, more explicit frameworks like
Sinatra, but the sooner you [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) how Rails
sees the world the more productive you'll be.

Migrating flashcards should be farily straight forward but offers opportunities
to explore nesting. Stack Overflow is a more complex domain, but will push your
skills.

## Objectives

If you need a specific area to focus on, [Rails form helpers][helpers] are a
great place to start.  Form helpers are the collection of view helpers that
Rails uses to generate, manipulate, and submit forms.

## Releases

Use the same release structure from the Sinatra project you choose.

## Optimize Your Learning

Make sure you understand every line of code you're writing. Don't copy and paste.
