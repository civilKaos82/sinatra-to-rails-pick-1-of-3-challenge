# Sinatra To Rails (Choose One)

## Summary

 Pick one of the following Sinatra-based challenges and build it in Rails:

1. [Web Flashcards Challenge](../../../web-flashcards-challenge)
1. [Stack Overflow Clone](../../../sinatra-overflow-challenge)

Focus on doing things the "Rails way." The "convention over configuration" can be frustrating coming from more explicit frameworks like Sinatra.

The sooner you understand and learn how Rails sees the world, the more productive you'll be.

Migrating flashcards should be farily straight forward but offers opportunities to explore nesting (resources and routing). Stack Overflow is a more complex domain, but gives you the opportunity to see how efficient and productive using Rails can be.

## Objectives

Part of grasping "The Rails Way" is to make use of [form helpers][] and [url-helpers][].

These tools allow you to write much less code (sometimes a single line) and have Rails generate forms that are REST-compatible, resource-oriented, and guarded from certain types of web traffic hacks (e.g. [CSRF attacks][csrf])

## Releases

Use the same release structure from the Sinatra project you choose.

## Optimize Your Learning

Make sure you understand every line of code you're writing. Don't copy and paste.
